I created this small project for myself. This means that it is very coupled
with my working environment and it may not work correctly or may not work at
all on other environments.

Anyway, if you're brave enough to download, use it and write patches to make
it work on a broader platea, feel free to contact me or to push patches in
this GIT tree.
