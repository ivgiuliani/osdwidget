OSDWidget is a python script that display informations like CPU speed, battery
temperature and other stuff through OSD.

I created this small project for myself. This means that it is very coupled
with my working environment and it may not work correctly or may not work at
all on other environments. As a consequence of this, I haven't publicized nor
published this project anywhere, so if you came across this README means that
you somewhat found it through google or equivalent source :)

Anyway, if you're brave enough to download, use it and write patches to make
it work on a broader audience, feel free to contact me or to push patches in
this GIT tree.

As as a side note, this project is distributed using the GPLv2 license.
